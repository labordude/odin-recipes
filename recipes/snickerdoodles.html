    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 TABLEspoons unsalted butter, at room temperature*</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 TEAspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 TEAspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 TEAspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups King Arthur Gluten-Free Measure for Measure Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Coating</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 TABLEspoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 TEAspoons cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>


    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.</li>

    <li><strong>To make the cookies:</strong> Beat together the butter and sugar until smooth. Add the egg, beating until smooth. Beat in the vanilla, salt, and baking powder. Add the flour, mixing until totally incorporated.</li>

    <li><strong>To make the coating:</strong> Shake together the sugar and cinnamon in a medium-sized zip-top plastic bag.</li>
    <li>Drop small (1"-diameter) balls of dough into the bag; a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here. Roll/toss the cookies in the cinnamon sugar until they're completely coated.</li>
    <li>Space the cookies at least 1 1/2" apart on the prepared baking sheets. Use a flat-bottom glass to flatten them to about 3/8" thick; they'll be about 1 1/2" in diameter.</li>
    <li>Bake the cookies for 8 minutes (for soft cookies) to 10 minutes (for crunchier cookies). Remove them from the oven, and cool them on the pan until they're firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Store any leftover cookies, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.</li>
