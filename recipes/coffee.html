    <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>   Starbucks took its delicious nitro cold-brewed coffee and topped it off with sweet cream flavored with vanilla. The combination makes a rich and creamy iced coffee drink you’ll want to enjoy over and over again.</p>
   <p>But that can get expensive when getting it at the restaurant. So why not save money and make it at home? And you don’t need to get big bottles of expensive store-bought coffee syrup either.</p>
   <p>All you need to do is to make vanilla simple syrup, mix it with milk and cream, and you have homemade vanilla sweet cream.</p>
   <p>Then you’ll add that to cold brew coffee, which is also super easy to make. Just steep coffee grounds in cold water overnight. Find out more in my thorough guide on how to make cold brew coffee.</p>
